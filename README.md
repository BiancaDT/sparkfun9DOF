# Sparkfun 9DOF Test and installation

Sparkfun 9DOF is an inertial measurement unit with nine deegres of freedom. It includes three kinds of sensors :

1. accelerometer
2. gyroscope
3. magnetometer

Sensors give informations along the three space axis.

This repository show how to configure and use this IMU. To reproduce these tests, just follow these steps :

1. [Installation under Windows](https://github.com/fbuloup/sparkfun9DOF/tree/master/1_WindowsInstallation)
2. [Installation of Jupyter](https://github.com/fbuloup/sparkfun9DOF/tree/master/2_Jupyter)
3. [Acquire data with unit](https://github.com/fbuloup/sparkfun9DOF/tree/master/3_IMU_DACQ)

If your are using OSX or Linux, just replace step 1 with step 4. Step 5 allows you to configure charts for Jupyter notebook.
